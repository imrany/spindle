# üï∏Ô∏è Spindle

**Spindle** is an open-source, lightweight **web crawler and scraper**.
It can discover links on the web (_crawler_) and extract structured data from webpages (_scraper_).

## ‚ú® Purpose

- **Crawler** ‚Üí Navigates pages and discovers new URLs.
- **Scraper** ‚Üí Extracts specific information from a given page (title, description, favicon, links, images, and videos).

Together: Spindle explores **what to scrape** and **extracts the data you care about**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. Takes an input URL (from CLI or API).
2. Fetches the HTML.
3. Extracts structured data:

   - Title
   - Description
   - Links
   - Favicon
   - Images
   - Videos (if available)

4. In crawler mode, follows links to discover additional pages.
